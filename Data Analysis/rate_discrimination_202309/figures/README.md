###
- fig1 shows the change of state percentage for completed trials across sessions. Green/light green are reward/naive reward, and red/light red are punish/naive punish. The x-axis is the seesion day and y-axis is the percentage. Four subplots correspond to four subjects.
- fig 2 is like fig 1 but gives the percentages of all outcomes.
- fig 3 shows the outcome percentages changing within a session. Trial outcomes are binned with some size and we compute the percentage for the trials within a bin. Each line gives one outcome.
- fig 4 is the psychometric plot. The xaxis is the stimulus interval and yaxis is the proability of right choice. Trials within a session have been binned and we calculate the mean for each bin. Different colors show different sessions.
- fig 5 is a sanity check for the stimulus interval. Each dot represents one isi, and all isi from one session has been merge. Dots are transparent, so when there are multiple dots in one position the color will be deeper.
- fig 6 checks the time difference between visual and auditory signal to make sure they are synchronized.
- fig 7 checks whther early choice is related to ITI for the most recent several sessions.
- p 1 is the psychometic functions for two mice.
- p 2 gives the reaction time vs the probability of correctness. Before post-perturbation stimulus around 1.8s, the probability should be around 0.5 because they do it by chance. After that the probability should increase as they receive longer post-perturbation stimulus.
