Absolutely—here’s a concise, field-tested map of popular ways to filter, sort, and group calcium fluorescence (ΔF/F) traces, with one-line “what/why” blurbs and acronyms expanded.





Preprocess & Clean (filtering before grouping)

NoRMCorre — Non-Rigid Motion Correction: online piecewise-rigid registration; fast and scalable for large FOVs. 
PubMed
GitHub

FISSA — Fast Image Signal Separation Analysis: neuropil decontamination via local “surrounds” + NMF; improves single-cell ΔF/F specificity. 
Nature
PubMed








Extract ROIs & Traces (who’s a neuron + their time series)

Suite2p: end-to-end pipeline (registration, ROI detection, neuropil correction, traces); very fast, widely adopted. 
BioRxiv
+1

CaImAn: open-source toolkit incl. CNMF/online CNMF and multi-session registration; highly scalable. 
eLife
PMC

CNMF-E — Constrained NMF for Endoscopic (1-photon): handles large, fluctuating background; strong for miniscope data. 
eLife
PMC

EXTRACT: robust, GPU-accelerated cell extraction with good false-positive control. 
BioRxiv

MIN1PIPE: miniscope-focused extraction pipeline; practical for 1-photon videos. 
PMC

CellSort (PCA/ICA): classic PCA→ICA demixing; still useful baseline/teaching tool. 
PMC

HNCcorr / SCALPEL: alternative segmentation (combinatorial/dictionary-learning) when CNMF-style methods struggle.

Infer Events/Spikes (denoise & standardize activity for sorting)

OASIS: fast sparse deconvolution to estimate spikes from ΔF/F online. 
PLOS
PMC

MLspike: model-based spike inference (indicator kinetics, baselines) for accurate event timing. 
Nature







Sort / Group by Activity Patterns (make rasters coherent; find ensembles)

Rastermap: orders neurons along a manifold so rasters become visually coherent; great for “functional sorting.” 
BioRxiv
PyPI

HDBSCAN + UMAP/t-SNE: density-based clustering atop nonlinear embeddings to group ROIs by trial-locked dynamics (parameter-light, noise-robust). (General methods; pairs well with your pipeline.)

SeqNMF — Sequential Non-negative Matrix Factorization: discovers repeated temporal sequences directly from calcium activity; ideal when dynamics are motif-like. 
eLife
PMC








Demix by Task Variables / Latents (separate short vs long ISI, etc.)

dPCA — Demixed PCA: linear reduction that separates variance by task factors (stimulus/choice/ISI), aiding interpretability. 
eLife

GPFA — Gaussian-Process Factor Analysis: smooth low-dimensional latent trajectories per trial; good for ramping/dynamics comparisons. 
PubMed

(Tensor) Component Analysis / TCA: 3-way factorization (neurons × time × trials) that cleanly splits cell/temporal/trial factors for population motifs. 
PubMed

Longitudinal Alignment (grouping across days/sessions)

CellReg: probabilistic cross-session ROI matching with confidence scores; standard for chronic imaging. 
PubMed











All-in-one / GUI pipelines (useful for end-to-end or validation)

Minian (Python): open-source pipeline with interactive viz/validation; laptop-friendly. 
eLife

If you like, I can suggest drop-in swaps for parts of your stack (e.g., FISSA before ResNet features, OASIS before UMAP/HDBSCAN, dPCA downstream of your ramp-aligned rasters) and sketch minimal code/parameters to try next.
